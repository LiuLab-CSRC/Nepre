Introduction
-----------
Nepre potential include two typical method, it can provide two major options for user:
* Calculate the potential energy using different cutoff.
* Calculate the potential energy using the radius of amino acid. 

For the first method, users can use the cutoff between 4 angstrom to 10 angstrom to calculate the potential energy.
For the second method, we statistic 30,000 high-resolution protein and use gaussian distribution function to fit the radius
of every radius. Then Nepre will calculate the potential energy according to the radius of each amino acid.
